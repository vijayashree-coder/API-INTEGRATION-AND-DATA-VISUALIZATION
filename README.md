__1. Introduction__

In recent years, data-driven decision making has become essential in understanding global events. The COVID-19 pandemic generated a huge amount of data related to confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases across countries.
This project focuses on fetching real-time COVID-19 data from a public API and visualizing it using Python libraries to gain meaningful insights.

__2. Objective of the Project__

The main objectives of this project are:

- To fetch real-time COVID-19 data using a public REST API.

- To process and analyze the data using Python.

- To visualize important insights using graphs and charts.

- To present the data in a simple dashboard format for easy understanding.

__3. Scope of the Project__

- Country-wise COVID-19 data analysis.

- Comparison of top affected countries.

- Visualization of confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, and active cases.

- Suitable for beginners in API integration and data visualization.


__4. Tools and Technologies Used__

| Tool / Technology       | Purpose                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Python                  | Programming language         |
| Requests                | Fetch data from API          |
| Pandas                  | Data processing and analysis |
| Matplotlib              | Data visualization           |
| Seaborn                 | Advanced visualization       |
| Public API (Disease.sh) | COVID-19 data source         |

__5. Methodology__

- The Python program sends a request to the public COVID-19 API.

- The API returns data in JSON format.

- The JSON data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame.

- Data is cleaned and sorted to identify top affected countries.

- Visualization graphs are generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- Multiple charts are displayed together as a dashboard.

__8. Data Visualization Details__

- The dashboard includes:

- Bar Chart: Top 10 countries by total COVID-19 cases

- Bar Chart: Top 10 countries by total deaths

- Bar Chart: Comparison of recovered vs active cases

- Clear titles, labels, and legends for better understanding

__9. Sample Output Description__

- The bar chart shows countries with the highest number of confirmed cases.

- Another chart highlights countries with the highest death rates.

- A comparison chart displays recovered cases versus active cases globally.

- These visualizations help identify trends and severity levels.


__10. Advantages of the System__

- Uses real-time data.

- No API key required.

- Easy to understand visual output.

- Helps in quick decision-making.

- Beginner-friendly project.

__11. Limitations__

- Depends on internet connectivity.

- Data accuracy depends on the API provider.

- Historical data analysis is limited.

__12. Applications__

- Health data analysis.

- Government and policy planning.

- Educational and research purposes.

- Data analytics learning projects.

__13. Conclusion__

This project successfully demonstrates how public APIs can be integrated with Python to fetch real-time data and visualize it effectively. By using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, complex COVID-19 data is transformed into meaningful visual insights. The project enhances understanding of API integration and data visualization concepts and serves as a strong foundation for future data analytics projects.
